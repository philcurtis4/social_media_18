# Social Media Back-End
## Description
This project was undertaken as part of a coding bootcamp. The goal of this challenge was to creat the back-end of a social media app using mongoose and MongoDB. I create routes that would create users and allow the users to create thoughts. Then the users could add other users as friends. Users could also add reactions to other users thought posts.
